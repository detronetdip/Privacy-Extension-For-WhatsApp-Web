The Privacy Extension For WhatsApp Web has encountered some issues lately, mainly due to sudden updates pushed by WhatsApp. As a temporary fix, I've made some adjustments to the extension's source code. While it's not fully functional, the modified version should offer some relief until the original author, lukaslen, updates it officially. You can access the modified extension on GitHub at this link(https://github.com/detronetdip/Privacy-Extension-For-WhatsApp-Web). 

Please note that all credit goes to [lukaslen](https://lukaslen.com/) for creating the original extension. I'm currently working on refining the modified version and plan to submit a pull request to the original repository. If lukaslen prefers, I can remove or permanently delete the modified codebase.

Here's a summary of the current working functionalities:
- All message in chat
- Last message preview
- profile picture
- group/usernames
- unblur all on app hover
